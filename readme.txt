MGE aka Micro Game Engine its a cross platform PSP / Windows (DirectX) game engine

MGE it's been ported to PSP from my original Windows(DirectX) 2D gaming library.
Its has changed a lot from original code, so I've re-write the windows version.
Windows version try (no really accurately) to match the real PSP speed.
PSP Screen mode 565 its simulated on Windows.

Input control its simulate with Windows Keyboard, or Joystick.
Even its cross platform and could run under Windows(DirectX), MGE still focus on PSP.
Windows version could bean debugging, and trace it.
